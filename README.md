# Data-Driven-Insights-Airbnb
Predictive model for pricing for airbnb dataset focusing on data analysis and visualizations for insightful feature extraction for modelling.


## Description

Develop a predictive model for Airbnb price prediction, utilizing a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings in New York containing 102,058 samples and 26 unique attributes. Our main goal is to offer a valuable tool for hosts and guests, enabling them to make informed choices when it comes to Airbnb property listings, while also allowing for more effective budget planning. Different methods ranging from Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XGBoost will be explored for the creation of the final prediction model.

## Data

Airbnb dataset from Kaggle containing 102,058 samples and 26 unique attributes. Data Cleaning process was focused by cleaning missing values either by replacing them with mean or deleting unncessary ones. Removing uncessary charachters like '$' in colums price, etc., converting specific columns to datetime and identifying outliers.<br>
